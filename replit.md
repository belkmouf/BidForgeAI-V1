# BidForge AI - Construction Bidding Automation System

## Overview

BidForge AI is a construction bidding automation system that streamlines the proposal generation process for construction companies. The application ingests RFQ documents (PDFs, emails, ZIP files), uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector search to find relevant context from current and historical "Closed-Won" projects, and generates professional HTML bid responses using AI. Users can iteratively refine bids through an AI-powered chat interface.

The system is designed as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Express/Node.js backend, leveraging PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

   - Client name and project name fields

2. **Documents Table**
   - Auto-incrementing integer ID
   - Foreign key reference to projects with cascade delete
   - Text content storage and processing status flag
   - Upload timestamp tracking

3. **Document Chunks Table**
   - Auto-incrementing integer ID
   - Foreign key reference to documents with cascade delete
   - Text content with vector embeddings (1536 dimensions)
   - Chunk index for ordering

**Storage Layer Abstraction**
- Interface-based design (`IStorage`) for testability
- `DatabaseStorage` implementation using Drizzle ORM
- Methods for CRUD operations on projects, documents, and chunks
- Similarity search using cosine distance with pgvector
- Dashboard statistics aggregation (pipeline counts, win rate)
