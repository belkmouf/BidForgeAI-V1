# Step-by-Step: Viewing the Enterprise Design Changes

## Step 1: Start the Development Server ✅
You've already done this:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait until you see:
- "Server running on port 5000" or similar
- Vite compilation messages
- No errors in the terminal

## Step 2: Open Your Browser

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

2. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
   Or if that doesn't work, try:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## Step 3: Log In (If Needed)

- If you see a login page, enter your credentials
- If you don't have an account, you may need to register first
- Or if you're already logged in, you'll go straight to the dashboard

## Step 4: Navigate to Reports Page

You have **two options**:

### Option A: Click in the Sidebar
- Look for the **"Reports"** or **"Analytics"** link in the left sidebar
- Click it to navigate to the Reports page

### Option B: Direct URL
- In your browser address bar, change the URL to:
  ```
  http://localhost:5000/reports
  ```
- Press Enter

## Troubleshooting

### If the page doesn't load:
1. **Check the terminal** - Make sure the server is running without errors
2. **Check the URL** - Make sure it's `http://localhost:5000/reports`
3. **Try a hard refresh**: 
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### If you see the old design:
1. **Hard refresh** your browser (see above)
2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### If you get a 404 or error:
- Make sure you're logged in
- Try going to the dashboard first: `http://localhost:5000/dashboard`
- Then navigate to Reports from there
