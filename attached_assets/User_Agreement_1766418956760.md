**DRAFT USER AGREEMENT (TERMS OF SERVICE)**
**Platform:** BidForgeAI.com
**Last Updated:** December 22, 2025

---

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance

This User Agreement ("Agreement") is a binding legal contract between you ("User," "You," or "Customer") and **BidForgeAI** ("Company," "We," "Us," or "Our"). By registering for, accessing, or using the services provided at **bidforgeai.com** (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these terms.

**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.**

## 2. The Nature of AI Services

You acknowledge that the Service utilizes Generative Artificial Intelligence ("AI") technologies, including Large Language Models (LLMs), to assist in drafting, analyzing, and summarizing Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Quotation (RFQ) responses.

### 2.1 No Guarantee of Accuracy (The "Hallucination" Clause)

**IMPORTANT:** AI technologies are probabilistic and experimental. They may produce "hallucinations"—content that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unrelated to your input.

* **We do not guarantee** that the AI-generated content is accurate, complete, valid, or compliant with specific RFP requirements.
* **We do not guarantee** that the calculations, pricing models, or technical specifications generated by the AI are mathematically or technically correct.

## 3. Mandatory Human Verification ("Human-in-the-Loop")

**You agree that you are solely responsible for reviewing, verifying, and validating all output generated by BidForgeAI.**

### 3.1 Your Obligation to Verify

Before submitting, sharing, or relying on any content generated by the Service, you must:

1. **Verify Facts:** Cross-reference all technical data, dates, and compliance claims against the original RFP documents.
2. **Check Pricing:** Manually validate all financial figures, currency conversions, and cost estimates.
3. **Review Legal Terms:** Ensure that any generated legal language complies with your internal policies and the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are bidding.

### 3.2 Waiver of Reliance

You expressly agree that you will not rely solely on the Service for critical decision-making. You acknowledge that **BidForgeAI is a drafting aid, not a substitute for professional human judgment**, engineering review, or legal counsel.

## 4. User Liability for Submissions

**You assume full liability for any RFP, RFQ, or tender response you submit that utilizes content from BidForgeAI.**

* **Submission Errors:** If you submit a bid containing errors (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing certifications, false technical claims) caused by AI generation, **you bear the sole consequences**, including but not limited to bid disqualification, contractual penalties, financial loss, or reputational damage.
* **No Vicarious Liability:** BidForgeAI shall not be considered a partner, joint venturer, or co-author of your bids. We are a software provider only.

## 5. Intellectual Property

### 5.1 Your Data

You retain ownership of the data and documents you upload to the Service ("User Input"). You grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process this data solely to provide the Service to you.

### 5.2 AI Output

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, BidForgeAI assigns to you all right, title, and interest in the final output generated by the Service for your specific inputs.

## 6. Limitation of Liability (The "Shield")

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BIDFORGEAI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:**

1. **Lost Bids or Revenue:** Any loss of business, loss of contract, failure to win a tender, or loss of anticipated savings arising from your use of the Service.
2. **Inaccurate Content:** Damages resulting from errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the AI-generated content.
3. **Indirect Damages:** Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.

**CAP ON LIABILITY:** IN NO EVENT SHALL BIDFORGEAI’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO BIDFORGEAI FOR THE SERVICE IN THE **SIX (6) MONTHS** PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 7. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless BidForgeAI, its officers, directors, and employees from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with:

* **Your use of the Service.**
* **Any RFP/RFQ response you submit** (including claims by third parties regarding false advertising, breach of contract, or negligence).
* **Your violation of any third-party rights** (including intellectual property or confidentiality obligations contained in the RFPs you upload).

## 8. Data Security and Confidentiality

While we employ industry-standard security measures, you acknowledge that no AI processing pipeline is 100% secure. You agree not to upload highly sensitive information (such as state secrets, classified government data, or unredacted PII) unless explicitly covered by a separate Enterprise Agreement.

## 9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of [Insert State/Country, e.g., the State of Delaware]. Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration in [Insert Location], except that either party may seek injunctive relief in court.
