Replit Implementation Prompt: Document & RFP Orchestration Flow
Objective: Modify the existing application flow to implement a sequential, state-driven pipeline for RFP processing. Maintain the core logic of the individual agents and their interaction with the central Orchestrator, but update the UI/UX routing and backend handshakes.

1. The Workflow Sequence
Please implement/update the following sequential stages

	1.1 Document Upload Phase: A dedicated view for file ingestion.

if the document is an image trigger the sketch agent. and send json generated to summarization agent else trigger summarization agent

	1.2 Summarization Agent Phase: * Trigger the Summarization Agent immediately after upload.

Present the output in a format manner( bullets points, tables etc..) and in an editable text area.

The user must "Accept" or "Save" the summary to proceed.

	1.3 RFP Analysis Phase: Once the summary is accepted, pass the data to the Analysis Agent to extract key requirements and metadata.

	1.4 Conflict Check Phase: Run the analyzed requirements against historical data or internal constraints.

	1.5 Response Generation: Trigger the Generation Agent to produce the initial bid draft.

	1.6 Feedback & Iteration Loop: Provide a feedback interface where the user can submit corrections, triggering the Orchestrator to update the bid.

2. Technical Requirements
	2.1 State Management: Ensure the ProjectStatus in the database updates at each step (e.g., STATUS_SUMMARIZING, STATUS_ANALYZING, STATUS_COMPLETED).

Orchestrator Logic: The Orchestrator should remain the "brain." Do not change how agents process data; only change when they are called and how the user interacts with their output.

Persistence: Save the "Edited Summary" back to the database so the subsequent RFP Analysis phase uses the user-corrected version, not the raw agent output.

3. UI/UX Instructions
Create a "Stepper" component to show the user where they are in the process (Upload -> Summary -> Analysis -> Conflict -> Generation).

Add a "Review & Edit" screen specifically for the Summarization step before allowing the transition to RFP Analysis.
